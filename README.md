# Udacity Project A/B Testing

## Introduction
 * ### About this project
   this is my **Udacity's Advanced Data Analysis Nanodedegree** graduation project 


 * ### About A/B Testing
   A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists to test changes on a **web page** by running an experiment where a control group sees the      old version while the experiment group sees the new version
   
   the goal of the project is to help the company understand if they should:

     * Implement the new webpage
      
     * Keep the old webpage
      
     * Perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
